    <h1 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 40px;">Explore the World of Donna Mae</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">Growing up in a family of teachers, I instinctively had the desire to teach. When I learn something new, my heart would have this sudden urge to atomize what I&#39;ve ingested, but through the form of writing. At a very young age, as well all go through our phases in life, my interest in songwriting became the key to my soul. I wrote about the chronicles of my life through a song, and it was the most liberating feeling one could have ever felt. However, with much sadness, that intense admiration for songwriting became obsolescent when I found out my singing abilities didn&#39;t quite get to where I wanted them to be. Through years of self-discovery, I stumbled upon a fondness for research writing during my college years. That was the moment I discovered my true passion for writing. The appreciation was not in writing; I fell in love with the process of writing. I write because of the freedom to create, inspire, educate, persuade, address emotions, essentially anything that made my soul dance alongside of hoping that my writing temporarily patched up a wound a person was healing from. I wish for everyone to experience that spark of passion when your calling passes you by. Allow your creativity to flirt with your mind.</p>
